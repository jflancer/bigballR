\item{season}{Season following format yyy1-y2, ex "2018-19"}

\item{team.name}{Alternative to using the id, you can get a team from data(teamids) with a season and team name specification.
This inputs a team name, to be used along with season. This needs the school name not the complete team name, so "Duke" not "Duke Blue Devils".}

\item{use_chromote}{Use headless browser to get schedules. This is slower, but useful if you are getting errors about being forbidden to visit a link}
